dag_evaluator and task_scheduler are both python scripts.

Usage examples of dag_evaluator:
The task dependency relationship and task length is known in advance.
./dag_evaluator -d full bwamf_list2
./dag_evaluator -d full case1_list
./dag_evaluator -d full case2_list

The task dependency relationship is known in advance, and the tasks in the same level take similar time, but task length is not known in advance.
./dag_evaluator -d half case1_list_no_length 
./dag_evaluator -d half case2_list_no_length
./dag_evaluator -d half case3_list 
./dag_evaluator -d half case4_1 

The task dependency relationship is known in advance, and the tasks in the same level take different times, but task length is not known in advance.
Optimized Machine Number = max{dag_width, average_dag_width}.
./dag_evaluator -d zero case1_list_no_length 
./dag_evaluator -d zero case2_list_no_length
./dag_evaluator -d zero case3_list 
./dag_evaluator -d zero case4_1 

The task dependency relationship is known in advance, and the tasks in the same level take different times, but task length is not known in advance.
Optimized Machine Number = maximal parallel running task number (brute force algorithm, expensive)
./dag_evaluator -d zero_brute_force case2_list_no_length
./dag_evaluator -d zero_brute_force case3_list 
./dag_evaluator -d zero_brute_force case4_1
